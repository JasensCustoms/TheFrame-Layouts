Welcome to THE FRAME design guide, contained within is all the important details you need for designing your custom Top Panel for THE FRAME. The files provided are for non-commercial use only. Please use them to design your layout and top panel to fit onto your new FRAME. You can submit any of the following file formats for custom cut top panels:

* DXF
* AI
* SVG

On each piece there are mounting holes and some 24mm holes for buttons. Please take the follow into consideration:

Do not remove any mounting holes (the small ones) from the side panel plexi templates.
Do not move any mounting holes. If you move them, your plexi will not attach to your FRAME properly.
You may remove the center mounting holes on the top and bottom panels if you want.
On the side plexi pieces, any of the 24mm holes can be removed if you do not intend on using those cutouts. By removing them the plexi will cover up and hide unused holes.
You can make your top panel and bottom panels larger than your FRAME and have overhang - creating some cool shapes and possibilities for your FRAME. If you add a significant amount of overhang, you may want to consider using some 51mm long support hardware to prevent flexing. There are a lot of creative ways to do this from 3D printed parts to aluminum extrusion. Just keep in mind you will need to provide mounting hole cutouts on your plexi (top, bottom, and inner pieces) to ensure you have a place to feed non-standard hardware.

**The Top and Bottom Panel has two layers.**

The outermost layer is 1.5mm and can be done with printed plexi or any of our standard colored plexi available.

The inner layer is 5mm and will be done with clear, black, or white acrylic based on your choice.

**Top Outermost layer (1.5mm):**

1. Place your buttons and joystick in an arrangement that makes sense for you. You have complete control here. Keep your layout inside of the red lines dashed lines to ensure your buttons will not hit the FRAME. You must ensure all required mounting hardware is accounted for. We will not add or alter files submitted. We cut what you send.
   
3. The Blue Dashed lines represent how far the average 24mm button will extend into the case. You can get close to these if you need to, just be advised that wiring may get tight in those areas.
   
4. If you do not want to add countersinking to the inner layer for lever builds, please ensure your mounting hardware holes for the lever you are using is on the top outer layer.
Ensure you keep the M4 mounting holes in tact on the outermost layer per the above guidelines.

**Top Inner Layer (5mm):**

1. Duplicate all of your cuts from the outermost layer to this inner layer.
2. You will want to create offset cuts for all of your buttons. 6.5mm is too thick for non screw in buttons to latch onto. I find that using a 40mm hole for 30mm buttons on the inner panel is sufficient for snap ins. 45mm is great for screw in buttons. (36mm for smaller 24mm buttons). You can use the centers of your top layer holes to do ensure they are perfectly aligned. Once you create them all, you can remove the button cutouts on the inner layer they won't be needed.
3. You do not and should not create offsets for any mounting hardware on this layer.
4. For a nominal fee we will countersink lever mounting hardware on your inner panel using a drill press. This is done after its laser cut to ensure perfect placement.

This a perfect inner and outer layer. There are no extra cut lines on the inner layer. The customer used the pathfinder tool in illustrator to remove overlapping cut lines (or a power trim tool in Solidworks) to create one smooth contour cut for the inner panel. They are larger than the button holes to allow snap-ins and screw-ins to properly hold onto the 1,5mm top.

This is not per the design guide. The inner and outer layers are the exact same. You will not have a solid connection with snap-ins and they may pop out. Screw-ins may work, but they wont have enough threads engaged to stay tight long term. Fix the inner layer.

**The Bottom Panel - Inner and Outer pieces**

These should be mechanically identical. If you make the bottom a different and larger shape than the rounded rectangle that is standard, just ensure both are the same. If you only submit one file for the bottom, we will cut both the 1.5mm and 5mm pieces the same. If you have a special need for the inner panel to create additional clearance, its OK to put cutlines on the inner panel.

* Sanwa JLF Mounting Points: 84mm x 40mm rectangle. One hole in each corner. Center hole is 24mm.
* #6-32 screw diameter: 3.51mm - use 3.6mm to be safe.
* M4 screw diameter: 4mm (metric is great) - use 4.2mm to be safe.
* 30mm buttons: use 30.1 - 30.2mm to be safe. Using an exact 30 is OK but may add stress to the body.
* 24mm buttons: use 24.1 - 24.1mm to be safe. Using and exact 24 is OK but may add stress to the body.
