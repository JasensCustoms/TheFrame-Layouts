# Top Panel 1.5mm Outer Plexi Panel
+	The Taito vewlix layout with 100mm between the K1 button and lever
+	Main Button holes are 30mm buttons
+	A standard Japanese lever size hole on this top layer
+	A row of three 24mm buttons above the standard 30mm vewlix buttons. I’ve attached a photo as an example of the layout of these buttons

# Top Panel 5mm Inner Plexi Panel

+	Enough room underneath the buttons to accommodate screw-in buttons
+	A Korean lever-sized hole (35.1mm) for the joystick plus all mounting holes for both JP and KR levers
+	The same 7.5mm overhang on the left and right, with 2.5 mm on top and bottom. 

# Bottom Panel 5mm Inner Plexi Panel

+	A 100mm x 100mm cutout centered on the Joystick Lever to support deep Korean levers.

# Panel Size Changes

+	A 7.5mm overhang on the left and right edges, and a 2.5mm overhang on the top and bottom edges (to make the lever a little wider without getting much taller).
